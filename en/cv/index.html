	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

	<p>I am an international PhD student born in Mexico, I have lived in Japan for over 4 years and have gotten used to Japanese language and culture. I am now pursuing research and submitting papers. I received the B.S. and M.S. degree and am currently pursuing a PhD in Information Science and Control Engineering in the Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan under the instruction of Hirofumi Nonaka. I do research in Artificial Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining. My research interests are Text and Data mining for management purposes and multilingual endeavors.</p>

	<h3>Club and Circle Activities</h3>

	<p>I am the club leader of the Aikido club in my university, but there hasn't been any recent activity due to the pandemic. Not so much recently because of the pandemic, but since I was an undergraduate, I wanted to experience various martial arts, so I also participated in the karate club, judo club, kendo club, archery club, and Shorinji Kempo club. When I was in third year of undergraduate school, I also belonged to music circles and art circles, and even performed live at some points.</p>

	<!-- <h3>Efforts during my time in school</h3>

    <p>I have belonged to the same laboratory since I was an undergraduate. In that laboratory, I participated in various projects and researches and became a team leader in some of them. All of them were difficult, but I got to finish them thanks to teamwork, pressure from deadlines, somehow managing to produce results each time. Thanks to that, I was able to make presentations at academic conferences and participate in competitions. However, I started my own private project when I was an undergraduate. Since I was an undergraduate, I have been thinking of publishing the research results and submitting them to international academic journals. Regrettably, it wasn't accepted in the journals I chose at first, so I continued to refine the same research during my master's course, continue to produce results, and challenge myself to publish. Unfortunately, I was rejected about eight times. Five years later, I challenged myself to try to get it published for the ninth time came. I thought I would give up several times, but I ended refining it towards its best version ever, and the results and methods convinced the reviewers. After overcoming the difficulties and staying up several nights and getting the reviewers to approve, I was told by the editors that it needed futher revision. I was alone. I am the eldest senior in the laboratory, and the juniors who worked with me previously on this project had already graduated. My academic advisor helped me, but it wasn't enough to help the feelings of helplessness. Looking back, I don't know what I would have done without my advisor's strength, but I was able to continue because of that strength. </p>
	
	<p> Finally, five years after starting this research, I recieved the notice of acceptance. Looking back on myself, who had thought about giving up many times, now I think that it was right not to give up. I also learned how much I grew up over the five years by reading the previous versions of my paper. And I realized it was I who saw this to the end, and I was able to take pride in it. I would like to celebrate with the joy of being accepted, but I feel that there will be harder things that I should not give up even if I want to further in the future. I still have job hunting ahead of me, and I haven't finished my dissertation yet. From now on, I will have to overcome even bigger walls many times. But now, thinking about this moment, I decided to just keep in mind that I shouldn't give up. As a result, I have currently published two peer-reviewed international academic journals as the first author, one national academic journal, three international conference presentations, and co-authored in five international conferences.</p>


	<h3>My image of the future</h3>

    <p>I made an effort to find myself, so I dream of myself in the future when I find a place where I can work the way I am. I would like to work in a place where I can develop new technologies, discover new knowledge, and freely express ideas that arise from fresh perspectives and diversity. I think that a job that allows me to live anywhere by remote work, or a global workplace where I'd work in collaboration with people from various places, is also ideal for me. My philosophy is I don't live to work, but rather work to live. Therefore, rather than exhausting myself, I want to work for a company that I can go back home thinking I have gained something in my life after the day is over. And since I can speak various languages and have various skills not limited to IT, I would like to strive for a place where they are not wasted. Most of the things I'm studying in my doctoral course use natural language processing, but I'm also interested in various languages, so I think it's important that the languages I can speak are useful for my work. I would like to improve this world little by little by creating new AI infused with my own skills. I would like to develop something that benefits people. The reason I write this is that information engineering and AI, in particular, have recently been used in a way that makes people distrustful. But I believe that AI and information engineering have the power to improve the world. I want to be a version of myself who can bring that power to the world as much as possible.</p> -->

	<h3>Appeal Points</h3>

    <ul>
    	<li>Always thinking of improvements
	    <li>Open mind and multi-field knowledge
	    <li>I don't give up
	</ul>

				Since Nagaoka University of Technology became an SDGs hub university and started recruiting student promoters, I applied because I saw it as an opportunity to cooperate with more people in making the progress I wanted to see in this school. Recently, I 've been designing posters and presentations for promotion of events related to SDGs. Most recently, I organized an online lecture presentation on LGBT and gender, sexual and romantic minorities, and the problems queer people are facing in societies around the world, especially in Japan. I presented this lecture was during the Transgender Awareness Week 2020, both in Japanese and English. <a href="https://elisa-aleman.github.io/assets/publications/2020-11-16_LGBT_presentation.pdf"> You can see the slides here</a>. Previously, I also designed a poster for a cleaning event to pick up trash on the beach and also participated in said event. I recently edited an interview video to promote awareness of the situation of refugees. <a href="https://www.nagaokaut.ac.jp/annai/daigakusyokai/sdgs/senryaku.html"> Details of other activities can be found at this link </a>.

				At Gala Yuzawa Ski Resort, there are facilities such as skiing and snowboarding slopes, places for children and families to play in the snow, restaurants and public bathhouses, and since I was a staff member of the information desk, I needed to know everything. Among my jobs I helped customers who were in trouble with lockers, I memorized  discounts on lift tickets, connections with JR, recommended gear rental sets, etc., provided guidance in multiple languages so that foreigners do not get lost when getting off the station, etc. Other jobs were to manage lost and found objects, store luggage and make announcements. I and other foreign staff were especially expected to be multilingual. In my case, I was in charge of Japanese, English, and Spanish, but sometimes at the lift ticket office, I did my best to memorize greetings in Chinese, Thai, and Malay so that customers could enjoy themselves from the beginning every day.
				<div class="cv_notes_title">
					Appeal points
				</div>
				I was in charge of customers that spoke Japanese, English, and Spanish. It was important for me to come up with expressions and ways of dealing with honorific language other than in Japanese so that customers could be treated politely. I made announcements in multiple languages too. And since it was an information desk, I sometimes showed around hotels and other interest spots as well as share information of other ski resorts.
