    <h2>Who am I?</h2>

    <p>My name is Elisa Claire Alemán Carreón. I was born in Mexico and am living in Japan.  I'm also a queer and transgender woman, data science researcher, artist and martial artist, and I intend to normalize LGBTQ+, mental health and neurodiversity. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Information Science and Control Engineering in the <a href="https://www.nagaokaut.ac.jp/e/">Nagaoka University of Technology</a>, Nagaoka, Japan. This page is dedicated to show my contributions to academic research and collect in one website the different places where I'm displaying my publications and contributions.</p>

    <p>I've been in Japan for 5 years, and I am currently doing my research in the Knowledge Mining Laboratory in NUT, under the guidance of Dr. Hirofumi Nonaka. I do research in Artificial Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining. My research interests are currently Text and Data mining for management purposes and multilingual endeavors.</p>

    <p>Because Mexican names have two family names, many automatic crawlers show me as ECA Carreón in the papers I've authored, but this is incorrect. If you want to cite my work, Elisa is my first name, Claire my second name, and Alemán Carreón is my surname. </p>

    <h2>What do I do?</h2>

    <p>Right now, my main interest is research in the Information Science area. I've been striving to make several publications to international journals and conferences. In my free time, I am also an artist, I mainly use ink on paper. I also do many martial arts, and I am the president of the Aikido club in my university, while I also do Karate in my free time. In the past, I've also participated in musical ensembles with my ocarina and quena.</p>

    <p>I also am a member of the <a href="https://www.nagaokaut.ac.jp/e/annai/intro/sdg/index.html">SDGs promoters in Nagaoka University of Technology</a>. Currently I've been doing design work for promotion of events related to <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">SDGs</a>, and the latest I did was organize and make an online lecture presentation about LGBT and Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities and the problems that queer people face in society around the world, and specifically in Japan. I did it during the Transgender Awareness Week 2020. You can see a PDF version of my presentation <a href="/assets/publications/2020-11-16_LGBT_presentation.pdf">here</a>, with slides and content in English and Japanese.</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I also study other languages and make static websites from scratch! (HTML and CSS only). In fact, I made a website for my language studying notes, here it is:</p>

    <p> I'm studying Polish using Duolingo and making a website about the lessons and the grammar used in them! You can check it out over here:</p>
